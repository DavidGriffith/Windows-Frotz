<h1>The IF Archive</h1>
The IF Archive is the central site on the Internet for text adventures and related interpreters,
compilers and other tools. The Archive has an unrivalled collection of material relating
to text adventures, including something in the region of two thousand games.
<p>
Formerly at the FTP site <b>ftp.gmd.de</b>, it is now at the web site
<a href="http://www.ifarchive.org/">http://www.ifarchive.org/</a>.
The Archive is also still accessible through FTP, at
<a href="ftp://ftp.ifarchive.org/if-archive/">ftp://ftp.ifarchive.org/if-archive/</a>.
You might also like to consider using one of the Archive's mirror sites, which are listed
on the Archive's home page: depending on where you are, you might well find a mirror that
responds faster than the main Archive site. 
<p>
The Archive's main collection of Z-code games is in the
<a href="http://www.ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archiveXgamesXzcode.html">games/zcode</a>
directory. As the archive contains many hundreds of games, finding one to play can be
daunting: two sites that aim to help with this are 
<a href="http://www.wurb.com/if/index">Baf's Guide to the Archive</a> and
Mike Robert's <a href="http://www.ifdb.tads.org/">Interactive Fiction Database</a>,
both of which provide information and reviews of games in the IF Archive.
