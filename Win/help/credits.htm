<h1>Credits</h1>
Windows Frotz was written by David Kinder, based on Frotz 2.42. Frotz versions up to 2.32 were written by
Stefan Jokisch, who then handed the project on to Jim Dunleavy, who released Frotz 2.40. David Griffith released
Unix Frotz 2.41 and 2.42 based on this. As well as adding a Windows interface, I have extended the Frotz 2.42
core to support menus and to use Unicode for characters throughout.
<p>
Some source code and many useful ideas have been taken from Kevin Bracey's Acorn RISC OS interpreter Zip 2000.
Use has also been made of the source code for WinFrotz by Rich Lawrence.
<p>
The interpreter contains bitmap scaling code written by Eran Yariv. The code that handles Ogg Vorbis music
is based on code submitted by David Moreno.
<p>
Windows Frotz was translated into German by Lothar May, into Italian by Tommaso Caldarola, into Spanish by
Javier San José, into French by Jean-Luc Pontico, and into Russian by Nikita Tseykovets.
<p>
Windows Frotz uses jpeglib by the Independent JPEG Group; libpng by Guy Eric Schalnat, Andreas Dilger, Glenn
Randers-Pehrson, and others; zlib by Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler; ModPlug by Olivier Lapicque; and
libogg and libvorbis by the Xiph.org Foundation.
<p>
This interpreter would not have been possible without those who have worked to understand and document the
<nobr>Z-Machine</nobr> in all its various forms: The InfoTaskForce (David Beazley, George Janczuk, Peter Lisle,
Russell Hoare and Chris Tham), Matthias Pfaller, Mike Threepoint, Mark Howell, Paul David Doherty, Stefan Jokisch,
Graham Nelson, and many others.
